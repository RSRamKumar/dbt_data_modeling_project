# 🏪 Ecommerce Data Warehouse (Snowflake + dbt)

🔹 **Tech stack**: Snowflake + dbt  
🔹 **Data model**: Medallion architecture → Star schema  
🔹 **Purpose**: Analytics-ready sales data for Shop (fictitious e-commerce store)

## 📌 Project Overview

  

This project demonstrates a modern data warehouse on **Snowflake** using **dbt** for data modeling and transformation.

  

The Jaffle Shop dataset (a fictitious e-commerce store) to model sales transactions into a star schema with fact and dimension tables is used.

  
  

## 🏗️ Architecture

  

Medallion-style architecture is followed:

  

 - **Bronze (Raw / Source)** → Raw ingestion tables (`raw_customers`, `raw_orders`, etc.)
   
 -  **Silver (Staging + Intermediate)** → Cleaned staging models (`stg_*`) and business logic aggregations (`inter_*`)
     
 -  **Gold (Marts)** → Final dimensional models and fact tables (`dim_*`, `fct_*`, `*_summary`)



📊 **Final Schema: Star Schema**

- **Fact tables**
  - `fct_orders` → 1 row = 1 customer order  
  - `fct_order_items` → 1 row = 1 product sold in an order  

- **Dimension tables**
  - `dim_customers`  
  - `dim_products`  
  - `dim_stores`  
  - `dim_dates`  

- **Marts (Aggregates)**
  - `customer_orders_summary` → Customer-level metrics  
  - `store_sales_summary` → Store-level metrics  
  - `daily_sales_summary` → Store × Day metrics (trend analysis)  
  - `product_sales_summary` → Product-level metrics

## 📂 Data Source

  

The dataset contains 6 raw tables loaded into Snowflake:

- `raw_customers`  
- `raw_orders`  
- `raw_order_items`  
- `raw_products`  
- `raw_supplies`  
- `raw_stores`

## 🔄 Modeling Layers

### 1. **Bronze (Raw Data)**

Data is loaded directly into Snowflake from CSVs

### 2. **Silver (Staging + Intermediate)** 

 - Staging models (stg_*) → Standardize column names, enforce data
   types, add load timestamps
   
   
  - Intermediate models (inter_*) → Business aggregations
    -  inter_orders_enriched: 1 row = 1 order with customer & store info
    -  inter_order_items_agg: 1 row = 1 customer order aggregate
    -  inter_product_sales_agg: 1 row = 1 product with sales stats
    

### 3. **Gold (Facts, Dimensions & Marts)** 

- Dimension tables: `dim_customers`, `dim_products`, `dim_stores`, `dim_dates` 
- Fact tables: `fct_orders` (One row = one customer order), `fct_order_items` (One row = one product sold in an order) 
- Marts: `customer_orders_summary`, `store_sales_summary`, `daily_sales_summary`, `product_sales_summary`

## 📈 Business Use Cases

  

This warehouse supports analysis such as:

  

 - Total sales by store, product, or customer
   
     
   
 
 - Top-selling products and categories
      
        
     
 - Customer lifetime value (CLV)
         
           
 - Average order value (AOV)
